Alternative sites can be found [here](https://t.me/TeleBotHelpChat/272145), incase the top one doesn't work.

### The Normal Way

Simply clone the repository and run the main file:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/arjboy/TeleBot
cd TeleBot
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 venv
. ./venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# <Create local_config.py with variables as given below>
python3 -m telebot
```

An example `local_config.py` file could be:

**Not All of the variables are mandatory**

__The Userbot should work by setting only the first two variables__

```python3
from heroku_config import Var

class Development(Var):
  APP_ID = 6
  API_HASH = "eb06d4abfb49dc3eeb1aeb98ae0f581e"
```

**Heroku Configuration**
Simply just leave the Config as it is.

**Local Configuration**
Check [Line 111](https://github.com/Total-Noob-69/X-tra-Telegram/blob/master/userbot/uniborgConfig.py#L111) and start adding your vars there.
Fortunately there are no Mandatory vars for the UniBorg Support Config.

## Mandatory Vars

- Only two of the environment variables are mandatory.
- This is because of `telethon.errors.rpc_error_list.ApiIdPublishedFloodError`
    - `APP_ID`:   You can get this value from https://my.telegram.org
    - `API_HASH`:   You can get this value from https://my.telegram.org
- The userbot will not work without setting the mandatory vars.
